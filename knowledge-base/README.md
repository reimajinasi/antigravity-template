# Knowledge Base (Central Repository)

Welcome to the `knowledge-base` directory. This directory serves as the primary information and reference hub for the **Project Factory**.

## Purpose
- **Context Source**: Storage for documents (Markdown, TXT, DOCX, XLSX, PDF) that serve as raw material for Project Factory composition.
- **Agent Reference**: Agents (especially the Interviewer) will read this directory to understand the depth and details of the assigned tasks.
- **Dynamic Storage**: You can add new documents at any time to strengthen the context of the Project Factory being developed.

## Rules of Engagement
1. **File Formats**: All document formats are supported (priority on `.md` and `.txt` for instant processing).
2. **Indexing**: Whenever a file is added, ensure to update [file-index.md](./file-index.md) to enable rapid navigation for the Agent.
3. **Context Loading**: The Agent may instruct you to place specific documents here if the existing information is deemed insufficient.

> [!NOTE]
> This directory currently serves as a template. Note that the **System Linguistic Engine** is powered by a hidden `.writing-style.md` file, which is a core component and not an output target.
