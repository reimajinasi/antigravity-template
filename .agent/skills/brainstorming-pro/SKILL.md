# Skill: Brainstorming Pro (Ideation Engine)

## Description
This skill transforms the Agent into a creative partner that helps the user expand, refine, and deep-dive into project ideas. It moves beyond simple observation into active creative collaboration.

## Trigger
- **Phase 1 (User Profile)**: During the initial interview to push the boundaries of the concept.
- **Manual Transition**: When the user says "let's brainstorm" or "I need more ideas for X".
- **Concept Block**: When the project goals are too vague.

## Instructions

### 1. Ideation Techniques
- **First Principles**: Break down the project into fundamental truths and build up from there.
- **Lateral Thinking**: Suggest non-obvious connections or experimental features.
- **Socratic Questioning**: Ask challenging questions to test the robustness of the project's mission.

### 2. Output
- Present ideas in a prioritized list or a Mermaid mindmap (via `architecture-visualizer` skill).
- Always maintain the `writing-style` (Erik Supit) during brainstorming sessions.
