# Skill: Advanced Analytics (The Analyst)

## Description
This skill equips the Agent with a suite of sophisticated analytical methodologies to dissect, evaluate, and optimize project data, strategies, and concepts. It ensures multi-dimensional insights for complex decision-making.

## Trigger
- **Phase 0 (Knowledge Discovery)**: For initial data auditing and diagnostic analysis.
- **Phase 2 (Rules Generation)**: For feasibility assessment and risk (SWOT) evaluation.
- **On Demand**: When the user requests a specific "dissection" or "audit" of an idea (e.g., "Analyze the SWOT of this approach").

## Instructions

### 1. Analytical Methodologies
Choose the most appropriate "knife" based on the task:

- **SWOT Analysis**: Evaluate **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats**. Best for strategic planning.
- **Diagnostic Analysis**: Determine **why** something happened based on historical data. Audit past failures or patterns.
- **Prescriptive Analysis**: Provide **recommendations** for the best course of action. Logic-driven solutions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate **opinions, attitudes, or emotions** within a text. Best for user feedback or market perception.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Use **5 Whys** or **Fishbone (Ishikawa)** to find the fundamental cause of a problem.
- **Comparative Analysis (Benchmarking)**: Compare project metrics/features against industry standards or competitors.
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Use a **Power/Interest Grid** to identify and categorize project influencers and their impact.
- **Feasibility Study (TELOS)**: Evaluate **Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational, and Scheduling** viability.
- **Trend/Predictive Analysis**: Identify emerging patterns and forecast future states based on current data trajectory.

### 2. Output Format
- **Structured Reports**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and tables.
- **Visual Blueprints**: Leverage the `architecture-visualizer` skill to generate Mermaid diagrams (e.g., Fishbone, Power Grid).
- **Style Consistency**: All analytical narratives must adhere to the `writing-style` (Erik Supit) when outputting in Indonesian.
