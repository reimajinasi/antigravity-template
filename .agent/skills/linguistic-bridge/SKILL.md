# Skill: Linguistic Bridge (The Polyglot)

## Description
This skill manages the seamless transition and separation between technical English and narrative Indonesian. It ensures that system files remain professional and technically accurate in English, while human interactions and stylistic outputs follow the Erik Supit writing style in Indonesian.

## Trigger
- **Always Active**: During any task involving both English (Technical) and Indonesian (Interaction/Narrative) content.
- **Phase 0-7**: Centralized control for document translation and consistency.

## Instructions

### 1. Mandatory Language Mapping
- **Technical English**: Variables, function names, rules, workflows, system agents, and terminal logs.
- **Indonesian (Jakarta-style)**: Chat interactions, direct user feedback, and proactive suggestions.
- **Indonesian (Erik Supit style)**: Final outputs like papers, context documents, and narrative reports (via the `writing-style` skill).

### 2. Translation Context
- **Do NOT translate**: Scientific terms, technical jargon, or file names (unless explicitly asked).
- **Ensure tone**: Technical docs must be formal and direct; chat must be casual and helpful ("Gue/Lo").
