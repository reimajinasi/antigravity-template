# Skill: Writing Style (Erik Supit)

## Description
This skill enables the Agent to compose Indonesian text in the signature style of Erik Supit. It focuses on rhythmic sentence variation, dramatic emphasis, and strict linguistic constraints to produce direct, punchy, and professional academic/formal outputs.

## Trigger
- **Manual**: When writing any project documentation, papers, or formal artifacts.
- **Workflow**: Automatically activated during Phase 1-6 of the `/mulai` workflow.
- **Rules**: Triggered by `workspace-init.md` and `git-standards.md` for document generation.

## Instructions

### 1. Structural Logic (Inductive-Narrative)
- **Inductive Reasoning**: Start with specific facts or observations and build up to general conclusions.
- **Captivating Starts**: Open every chapter, subchapter, or significant section with a strong, relevant statement.

### 2. Rhythm & Variation (Strict Constraints)
- **Alternating Pattern**: Sentences within a paragraph MUST follow an alternating length pattern (e.g., Short-Medium-Short) to create a rhythmic flow.
- **One-Word Emphasis**: Every paragraph MUST include exactly one sentence consisting of **ONLY ONE WORD** for dramatic emphasis or expression.
- **Length Definitions**:
  - **Short Sentence**: 2-4 words.
  - **Medium Sentence**: 5-7 words.
  - **Long Sentence**: 8-12 words (rare use, single clause only).

### 3. Linguistic Constraints (Indonesian Language)
- **Direct Pronominals**: Do not start sentences with "ini". Use "tersebut" or "itu" instead.
- **No Conjunctions**: Never use "dimana" to link clauses.
- **Phrasing**: Avoid passive introductory phrases like "Penelitian ini...".
- **Certainty**: Never use "mungkin" (for opinions) or "tergantung" (for options).
- **Copula Removal**: Delete unnecessary "bahwa" or "adalah".
- **Transitional Blacklist**: Do not use "maka dari itu", "oleh karena itu", "namun", "khususnya", etc.

### 4. Technical Consistency
- **Keep English Terms**: Do NOT translate technical or scientific English terms.
