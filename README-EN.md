# Antigravity 2.0: Operational Manifesto (EN)

Welcome. You are entering the **Antigravity** Template ecosystem. This is not a common code template. This architecture is an autonomous "Agent Factory" infrastructure. Specifically designed. Its purpose is to transform your strategic vision into an absolute intelligent system.

Understood? Good. Let us begin.

## 🚀 Step 0: Foundation of the Working Environment

A proper working environment is mandatory. The Antigravity protocol demands full support. Do not compromise.

1. **Get the Blueprint**: 
   - **Simple Option**: Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page and select **Download ZIP**. Extract it to your Desktop.
   - **CLI Option**: Run `git clone https://github.com/reimajinasi/antigravity-template.git` in your terminal.
2. **Download Antigravity IDE**: Visit the official site at [antigravity.google](https://antigravity.google/). Download the dedicated Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Immediately.
3. **Installation**: Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
4. **Account Activation**: Log in using your **Google/Gmail** account within the Antigravity IDE. This step is compulsory. It activates the full suite of intelligent assistant features we provide. Without a login, you are blind.
5. **Initialize Workspace**: Open this Antigravity template folder as your primary workspace. Focus.
6. **Verify Compass**: Ensure the `system-index.md` file is visible in the root folder. Navigation is key. Remember that.

## 🛠 Step 1: Constructing the Project Soul (/mulai)

This stage is the **Project Factory**. The Orchestrator will guide you in designing an identity.

1. **Trigger `/mulai`**: Type this command in the chat window. The discovery session begins.
2. **Vision Penetration (Phase 1)**: You will interact with `interviewer.md`. Communicate your project's vision, mission, and persona. Do not hesitate. Intellectual honesty is the primary foundation here.
3. **Structure Manifestation (Phase 2-5)**: A team of specialist agents will work. They draft the Rules, Workflows, and specific agent identities. Everything is unique.
4. **Skill Forging (Phase 5b)**: This is where the magic happens. The system will forge contextual "Skills". Specifically for you.
5. **Final Export (Phase 7)**: Once approval is granted, the Orchestrator will export the project folder to your Desktop. Complete with autonomous navigation instincts.

## 🔑 Step 2: Transition & Activation (/init)

The project is born. Now, shift your focus.

1. **Access New Workspace**: Use the Antigravity IDE to open the project folder on your Desktop.
2. **The `/init` Ritual**: This is the final cleanup procedure.
   - The `.agent/` folder is synchronized.
   - Factory documentation residue (`DOCS/`) is cleared. Totally.
   - The Orchestrator performs an "Identity Reset". It transforms into a dedicated agent loyal to your new vision.

## 🚨 Purity Protocol (Mandatory)

Technical integrity is non-negotiable. Follow these rules. Absolutely.

- **System Engine (English)**: All technical files in the `.agent/` folder **MUST** be written in Technical English. Machine accuracy depends on this. Do not use mixed languages.
- **Human Connection (User Language)**: Communication between the agent and you remains in your preferred conversational language. Effective. Efficient.
- **Context Separation**: The `knowledge-base/` folder is for reference data only. Never insert operational instructions within it. A grave mistake.

## 💡 Why Antigravity 2.0?

Innovation demands efficiency. We deliver it.

- **Precision Navigation**: Always refer to `system-index.md`. Do not get lost.
- **Pragmatic Response**: Agents are optimized for agility. Simple tasks are completed in the chat. Without document bureaucracy.
- **Anti-AI Detection**: The resulting writing structure is "unpredictable". A mix of long sentences and sharp interruptions. This is the key to naturalness.

Now, please type the `/mulai` command. Your innovation journey has just begun.

**Successful working.**
